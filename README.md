# Project Summary - EcoTrack: Democratizing Disaster Management

EcoTrack is a practical solution designed to bring crucial disaster management technology to communities most in need. Our system utilizes lightweight machine learning models, making it suitable for implementation on drones, a cost-effective alternative to traditional satellite methods.

## Accessible Technology:
By employing drones, we provide a feasible option for disaster monitoring in regions with limited resources. This approach ensures no community is left vulnerable due to budget constraints.
## Focused on Real Needs: 
EcoTrack prioritizes areas with less satellite coverage, addressing a real gap in disaster response strategies. Our goal is to enhance preparedness and reduce the adverse impacts of natural calamities.
## Humanitarian Impact: 
Beyond the tech, our mission is humanitarian. By increasing the reach of advanced monitoring tools, we're helping safeguard lives and livelihoods, particularly in underserved regions.
## Sustainable and Scalable: 
EcoTrack is built with sustainability in mind, promising a solution that's not only immediately beneficial but also adaptable for future challenges and needs.

Currently EcoTrack has the capability be used to detect the presence of wildfires
in media that it is given, able to help with wildfire crises
in areas with underfunded emergency services.

In summary, EcoTrack represents our commitment to leveraging technology for the greater good, ensuring that advanced disaster monitoring tools are not a privilege but a universal shield.
